# How to save the data on local storage.

'Local storage gives an API, and browser has API to directly access this and All of the JS has an access to this one.'
'If we just write localStorage in the fxn, then LocalStorage API will be invoked '

'SetItem: it takes as key, value pairs: key can be any type but value should always be string'

'JSON: Two types, Parse & Stringify', 'Stringify converts into string' & 'Parse: Parse it back from string to its whatever the original data type was.'

'Weather Application Learning: '
Whenever we are making a web request to any other server or to the database. (Remeber two things):
1. The server may throw some error, It's nor gurantee that if we are making request, response will back. So, Server may throw some error.
2. Server or Databse are in the other continent, It means we dont get response so quickly, it may take some time.


'Fetch'
The fetchAPI provides a JS interface for making HTTP requests and processing the responses. (MDN)

JS alone is not capable of making the web request. Either we need a node environment or a window envt from a browser to make
this HTTP Request.
