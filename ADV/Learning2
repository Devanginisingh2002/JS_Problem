'Asynchronous: It means break-down or having a pause in the language'
______________
|having pause| |----> 1. network calls 
-------------- |----> 2. write/read files
               |----> 3. time fn
               |-----> 4. userInput and more...
For above explanation, for these all four things, pause (async) works.

Event Loop: (Akshay Sir) (Already Done)

Closures: Basically, this is a function, they remember the environment in which they created. 
This means that, function can retain the variables which are declared outside of it.

Promises:
So, we can create a async behavior of javascript, by using a promises.
Promises are the utility in js.

* The way we create promise, using 'new' keyword:
fetchData(){
    return new Promise();
}

* Promise takes a callback also known as fxn.
* It takes two parameters resolve, rejected


'Prototypal Inheritance':
I understand this from gpt.
🧸 Imagine This:
You have a toy box 🎁 (that’s your object).
You open it and look for a toy (a property or method).
If the toy isn’t inside, you ask your mom 👩 (the prototype):
“Mom, do you have that toy?”
If your mom doesn’t have it either, she asks grandma 👵 (the next prototype).
This keeps going until someone finds the toy — or you reach the end (no one has it).
That chain — you → mom → grandma — is the prototype chain.
And this passing down of toys (properties) is called prototypal inheritance.

async/await/Promise-all
Instead of .then and .catch we can use async-await
We only use await when async already used.
