______________
|having pause| |----> 1. network calls 
-------------- |----> 2. write/read files
               |----> 3. time fn
               |-----> 4. userInput and more...
For above explanation, for these all four things, pause (async) works.

Event Loop: (Akshay Sir) (Already Done)

Closures: Basically, this is a function, they remember the environment in which they created. 
This means that, function can retain the variables which are declared outside of it.

Promises:
So, we can create a async behavior of javascript, by using a promises.
Promises are the utility in js.

* The way we create promise, using 'new' keyword:
fetchData(){
    return new Promise();
}

* Promise takes a callback also known as fxn.
* It takes two parameters resolve, rejected
